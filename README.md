# random_sampling_voting_vulnerability_study
In this paper, we present a systematic study on the resistance of an election with a randomly selected voter committee against bribery.



Some screenshots from our works-

This graph explains that the objective value in all three cases (opt (yours), nfold, grb) are very close. Very few cases it differs.

This plot states that runtime increases as the number of voters 'n' increases for all three cases.

This graph explains that
when m = 3, nfold performs better
when m = 5, nfold and gurobi performs likewise (converges)
when m = 10, gurobi performs better
